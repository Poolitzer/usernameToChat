=================
UsernameToChatAPI
=================

This project aims to give telegram bot developers an easy way to get Chat objects for usernames. The documentation
for the API itself lies in textRoutes.

This project is very much in an early alpha phase and should not be used in production.

=====================
Run your own instance
=====================

All you need to do is change the api id and hash in api_keys.py, as well as in the log.py file. You also should change
the api keys, and the owner insert in textRoutes. Then install the requirements and run main :)

Thanks for thinking about this. I use black and mypy for code quality, and I adhere to the CSI standard for commenting:

the ok first, I would hate for you to waste time if I think it doesn't fit.
